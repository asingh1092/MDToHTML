# Getting Started

This application will convert markdown text to html using a few rules:
  1. headers (h1, h2, h3, etc) with link text potentially
  2. paragraphs with link text pontetially
  3. Handle new lines by either ending a paragraph after a blank new line
     or continuing the paragraph if text continues on next line

This project uses Spring Boot with async. Default documentation is below.
